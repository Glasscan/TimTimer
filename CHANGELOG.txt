Python 2.7
Two files: Timer.py and Pause.py

-- Timer.py --
Creates a timer which accepts 3 kinds of input:
- seconds (default)
- minutes
- minutes and seconds

Timer will not accept any other input.

Example:
- 300s (or simply 300)
- 20m
- 30m 50s

The get_duration() method converts minutes into seconds for convenience sake.

Currently there is no way to choose the (default) alarm file. So what is
currently there is a hardcoded path for my own use.

I pulled the "siren" wavefile from freesound.org which then needed to be
converted to a .mp3 file via https://online-audio-converter.com/. Probably, did
not need to do that since I'm opening the file with os.system("")


-- Pause.py --
There is no built-in way to pause a [Timer] thread so the way that we pause
here is by noting the elapsed time, killing the current thread, and creating a
new one with the remaining time when the user wants to unpause.

Naturally, you can't pause after the time has run out; instead the script
will exit if you try.

Fixed some bugs with the inputs during pausing.

Did the obvious and changed the path to the siren-alarm.mp3 file to be local.


-- Timer.py --
Updated to support changing the default alarm file. The alarm  use is what is
written on the first line of DEFAULT.txt


-- setDefault.py --

Uses the tkinter module to select a new default .mp3 for the alarm.
Takes the chosen file and overwrites the current DEFAULT.txt with the new file
path.

Using this opens a ptyhonw.exe which I don't know what to do about.


-- DEFAULT.txt --

Single line with the path to the current "alarm".mp3.

Updated to python3.7 so had to change time.clock() to time.perf_counter().
New bug in which the first pause adds extra time.
